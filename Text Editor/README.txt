This Text Editor is the first version of an improved editing tool
Improved in a way that it proposes words' completion to make your typing faster than before or to help people having writing difficulties to write correct phrases 
the second version will have a programming mode which will make it even easier for the user to quickly change the color of the text only with typing so that he doesn't have to use  the mouse
In this first version i only use a unigram frequncy to predict completions but bigram word frequ could be used to give better predictions
Enjoy :)
